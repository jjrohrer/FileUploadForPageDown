FileUploadForPageDown
=====================

This is a working demo of making file uploading work with pagedown.  There really isn't any original code here, I just took inspiration from http://ben.onfabrik.com/posts/pagedown-markdown-editor-custom-image-dialog and got it working for me.  Infinite thanks Ben Foster.

Instructions
------------
* Put this on your server
* ensure the 'upload' directory is writable by the web server
* visit uploaddemoWithMd.php

Motivation
----------
Ben Foster wrote a post (http://ben.onfabrik.com/posts/pagedown-markdown-editor-custom-image-dialog) about how to add a file-uploader to PageDown.  He didn't include runable code, though, just a thurough explanation.  I spent some time getting a working demo going and figured that I would post it in case it helped somebody else.

I'm new to git, so be please be gentle - I'm sure there is a better way to make demo's using code from multiple repositories (well maybe, PageDown is hosted via mercurial)
